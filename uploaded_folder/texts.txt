De-ID seamlessly integrates into data management workflows, using advanced heuristics, lexical and syntactic context analysis to ‘read’ the text, identify PHI from non-PHI in narrative and create a separate, de-identified version of a note or text field.  De-ID retains the narrative integrity of the patients story by replacing PHI with proxies (e.g., NAME; PLACE; offset dates).  The software understands words in context, and can differentiate between when nouns are used as clinical terms (e.g., Hodgkins Disease: not PHI) and as names (e.g., Dr. Hodgkins: PHI) and permits client control of inclusion and exclusion rules..
